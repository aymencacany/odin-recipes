    <h2>Recipe Description</h2>
    <p>Matthew Bounds'Chicken Cobbler recipe is a super easy, 
        casserole-style, one-pan dish. It calls for low-lift ingredients such as rotisserie chicken, 
        frozen vegetables, cream of chicken soup and biscuit mix, but the end result is more than the sum 
        of its parts. This is definitely not light fare, but once you start eating it, it's hard to stop.

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>1/2 cup (1 stick) butter</li>
        <li>4 cups rotisserie chicken meat, shredded</li>
        <li>1 (15 ounce) bag frozen mixed vegetables (such as corn, peas, carrots and beans)</li>
        <li>1 (11.36 ounce) package Cheddar bay biscuit mix (such as Red Lobster Cheddar Bay Biscuit Mix)</li>
        <li>2 cups milk</li>
        <li>1 (10.5 ounce) can cream of chicken soup</li>
        <li>2 cups chicken stock</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons fresh chopped parsley (optional)</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C). Place butter in the bottom of a 9x13 baking dish and place in the oven to melt.</li>
        <li>When butter is melted, add chicken in a single layer over the butter. Top evenly with frozen veggies.</li>
        <li>Stir together biscuit mix, seasoning packet from the mix, and milk in a bowl until well blended; pour over the chicken and veggies. Spread lightly and evenly over the top of the  mixture but do not stir.</li>
        <li>Whisk together soup and stock in a second bowl until smooth. Pour over biscuit mix but do not stir.</li>
        <li>Bake in the preheated oven uncovered until very golden brown and only very slightly jiggly in the center, about 45 minutes.</li>
        <li>Sprinkle parsley over the top if desired and let stand for 10 minutes before serving.</li>
    </ol>
